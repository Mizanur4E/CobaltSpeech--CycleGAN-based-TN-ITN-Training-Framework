thank you is it d-i-a-n-a it's spelled d-a-y-a-n-a sandino where does she live in new  york any other children that's it just four does anyone else live with you in your house other than adriana at your current  address no before your home on northwest TWENTY SIXTH avenue where did you live just before that TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT northwest  FOURTH street apartment number TWO miami florida THREE THREE ONE TWO FIVE  apartment TWO or TWO HUNDRED THREE TWO HUNDRED THREE  yes sorry TWO HUNDRED THREE how long did you live at that address one year who did you live there with same my daughter and my  husband with hull and adriana correct anyone else live there with you during that time no where did you live before your  apartment on northwest FOURTH street ONE THOUSAND FORTY FIVE northwest TENTH avenue apartment number TWO miami florida THREE  THREE ONE TWO EIGHT was the address ONE THOUSAND FORTY FIVE northwest FIFTH street ma'am yes sorry i'm confused it's ONE THOUSAND  FORTY FIVE northwest FIFTH street sorry how long did you live with that address i don't remember very well but i believe three to  four years would it be from june of TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN to march of TWO THOUSAND TWENTY correct who did you live with that  address i'm not very sure but i think it was TWENTY TWO FORTY THREE northwest SIXTH street apartment number THREE i think no i  was asking you who you lived with at your apartment at northwest FIFTH street i lived with my two daughters adriana and dayana  sandino just so we're clear i'm talking about the apartment TWO on ONE THOUSAND FORTY FIVE northwest FIFTH street is that what  you're referring to yes sorry on the apartment on ONE THOUSAND FORTY FIVE northwest FIFTH street did you only live with adriana  and dayana sandino yes but then later dayana got married and she left did anyone else live with you at that apartment other than  your two daughters no not your husband we lived in separate homes okay so i'm a little confused because earlier you testified  that you've lived with him for eight years no we were together eight years but we were not married yes if i understand your  testimony has been that you were married four years lived with him eight and known him FIFTEEN that's what you testified to  previously yes yes okay i'm just trying to put it together ma'am because if you lived with him for eight years and we're in the  year TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE  that would take us back to TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN okay let me explain TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN we  didn't live together we lived in separate homes how many years have you lived together with your husband hull bien-aime whether  you were married or even including the period before you were married maybe six years okay i'm still just trying to put it  together ma'am because there's something wrong with the math somewhere okay if you lived together for six years would that not  include the time period that you lived at ONE THOUSAND FORTY FIVE northwest FIFTH street when i rented that apartment i rented it  with my two daughters sorry go ahead my husband and i were already together except that he lived in his house and i lived in mine  let's do it this way ma'am because i'm not understanding you but i'm trying my best other than your current apartment and the  apartment where you lived on northwest FOURTH street where else if anywhere have you lived with hull bien-aime those two okay  well those two ma'am add up to about a year and a half now you just said a moment ago that it wasn't eight years you lived  together it was six i'm just trying to understand where you lived together with him okay let me explain he lived in his he lived  in his house and i lived with him no sorry sorry sorry okay he lived in his house and i lived in mine he got he went he got to  ONE THOUSAND FORTY FIVE not to live but he would stay there so that's why i say well i'm trying to understand if you could tell  me what residences did you live together with hull bien-aime not where he just came to visit sometimes but where he actually  resided with you in the home what residence or properties have he actually live with you okay let's say at ONE THOUSAND FORTY  FIVE he was there for a year okay did you live with him anywhere else at TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT and now at SIX HUNDRED SIXTEEN okay  so just going off of what you've testified to so far you said that you lived at northwest TWENTY SIXTH avenue for the last two  months correct i moved in SIX HUNDRED SIXTEEN INCHES april oh no four months no it's it's four it's four months four months my  head hurts so i moved in april well let me make sure the record is clear ma'am so i think you're changing your testimony to say  that you've lived at your current address not two months but four months is that correct correct and before that you lived at  TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT northwest FOURTH street correct correct and you lived together with your husband hull at that address is that  correct correct and did your husband hull actually ever formally resided with you at northwest FIFTH street or he would just come  and visit he would get there and he would stay there okay during the four and a half years that you lived at northwest FIFTH  street at that period of time how long did hull stay at the property i'm sorry i'm confused could you repeat that again or the  court reporter please i'll repeat it okay during the time that you lived at northwest FIFTH street between june FIFTEEN to march  TWO THOUSAND TWENTY how often or what percentage of the time did your husband hull stay there overnight i don't remember or how  often would he stay there once a week once a night once a month i just need an example so could you provide me an estimate of how  often he would stay there almost every day for the entire four and a half years possibly you're not sure no okay so did mr  bien-aime have a separate home at that time yes he was renting a separate home yes when you were living with him at northwest  FOURTH street apartment TWO HUNDRED THREE was your husband renting a separate home at that time no so even though you were  married to him when you were living at northwest FIFTH street he still had his separate home is that correct correct okay where  did you live before strike that how long did you live at the apartment on TWENTY TWO FIFTY THREE northwest SIXTH street you said  TWENTY TWO FORTY THREE northwest SIXTH street did you mean TWENTY TWO FIFTY THREE northwest SIXTH street oh no you just said it  reversed mr interpreter oh did i okay yes sir she said TWENTY TWO FORTY THREE right okay you testified previously that you lived  at TWENTY TWO FORTY THREE northwest SIXTH street was it in fact TWENTY TWO FIFTY THREE northwest SIXTH street correct i just  forgot it's been a long time so how long did you live at that address ma'am perhaps eight years i don't remember exactly i'm  sorry just so we're clear we're talking about TWENTY TWO FIFTY THREE northwest SIXTH street apartment THREE you believe you lived  there about eight years yes so ma'am i'm looking at some answers to interrogatories which were provided to me by your attorney's  office that said you lived there from TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN to TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN is that incorrect TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN to TWO  THOUSAND SIXTEEN where we're talking about the apartment at TWENTY TWO FIFTY THREE northwest SIXTH street apartment THREE i lived  there a lot of years many years okay so to the extent your answers to interrogatories say you just lived there from TWO THOUSAND  FIFTEEN to TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN that's incorrect incorrect i'm sorry i just want to be clear do you believe it was six to eight  years or eight years or what's your answer as far as to how long you lived at that address asked and answered it's for many years  eight years maybe a little bit more with whom did you live at that address with my two daughters adriana and dayana sandino  anybody else no and did your husband visit there frequently as well strike it did hull bien-aime visit you frequently at the  apartment at northwest SIXTH street no would he stay overnight at that address no where did you live before the apartment at  northwest SIXTH street NINETEEN OH ONE  northwest south river drive apartment number SIXTY it's in miami yes how long did you  live there i don't remember exactly could you give me an estimate or your best approximation i understand you don't recall  exactly more or less i don't remember i i don't know if it was two years i i just don't remember who did you live there with with  my daughters and the father of my daughters did you live there with adriana dayana and max sandino correct where does max sandino  live now i don't know i don't know the address is it in miami yes if you can ma'am

last time you held a job  outside the home may SEVENTH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY by whom were you last employed amazon and what was your position with amazon  place boxes according to codes and where was the amazon location that you worked at the one in doral and counsel it's my  understanding based on answers to interrogatories that the plaintiff is not making any claim for lost wages or diminished earning  capacity in this case is that correct we may be making a claim if we do i'll subject her to a deposition based on that sorry i'm  just trying to make sure the record is clear because obviously under indiscernible ZERO ZERO FIVE EIGHT : FOUR SEVEN    wrong  answers it's saying you're not your client is not are you saying at present she is not but she can change in her mind in the  future or you're saying could be or might be making a claim right now because if she is i need to inquire now we may be making a  claim like i said if we do i would bring her back for a deposition and you're obviously going to ask her questions well all right  as long as i have a stipulation in the event that plaintiff is in fact trying to make a claim for lost wages or diminished in the  earning capacity that i have the right to depose her in the future on those questions related to those issues i'll forego that  today as long as i have that stipulation yeah a stipulation i'll stipulate that
